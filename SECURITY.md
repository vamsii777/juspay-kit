### What to Include in Your Report

- A description of the vulnerability

### What to Expect

As JuspayKit is currently maintained by a single developer, the response time and process may vary. However, here's a general outline of what you can expect:

1. **Acknowledgment**: You should receive an initial response within 1-3 days, confirming receipt of your report.

2. **Assessment**: The vulnerability will be investigated as soon as possible. This may take a few days to a week, depending on the complexity of the issue.

3. **Resolution**: If the vulnerability is confirmed, work on a fix will begin. The timeline for this can vary based on the severity and complexity of the issue.

4. **Disclosure**: Once a fix is ready, you will be notified. We will coordinate with you on an appropriate disclosure date.

5. **Release**: The fix will be released, and a security advisory will be published on GitHub.
